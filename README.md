PROJECT IDEA

- I wanted to do something to simplify meal prep.
- This is something a lot of us do when we have crazy schedule in the week and
    have no time/dont want to waste time thinking of what to cook.
-I meal prep every sunday for all my lunches when i was working/at the WDI course,
  and i always look for easy, healthy and quick recipes that i can use.
- So, i just hought that maybe i can solve my problem by coming up with a webpage that
does it for me

THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO DO IF I HAD MORE TIME:
- I would have liked to go one to version 2, 3 and 4.
- I have made a basic recipe table, where users can add their recipe name, steps
and a reference URL.
- But, i would like to make an ingrediants table and then a joins table and then
extract the ingredients to make a seperate list that the user can use as a grocery
list

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:
I started with a wireframe and some user stories for the project. I then spent
some time in trying to figure out the order of steps. Once i knew what to do,
i started with the basic HTML and Bootstrap to create a webpage that
somewhat resembled my wire frame. IT was really just a bunch of boxes that i
wanted to test.
NExt, i added the event handlers and made sure those were working.
Once, i had the CRUD working for Recipes, i did a little bit more of CSS & Sass.
Next, i deployed and tested to make sure that it was working on the deployed site.


 I got stuck on trying to do a few things that weren't necessarily part of the
 requirements. I had spent some time on it on day 2 and 3, but figured that
 it was something i will do once i finish the basic requirements. It was
 definitely a little trickier than i anticipated and makes me really
 appreciate the world of internet+websites a lot more than before
